# Blackjack
My first real python project.

## TODO List:
- [ ] Make Ace able to turn into either one or eleven depending on the hand.
- [ ] Make the player able to split it's hand if there are 2 cards of the same value.
- [ ] Make it possible to save progress into savefile
- [ ] Make a new shoe when previous one is empty
- [ ] The player doesn't have to press enter every time they want to preform an action, instead just press a number.
- [ ] Player can't bet over max bet amount.
- [ ] Log round loop to look for bugs.
- [ ] Make a bot that plays and logs gameplay (so that I don't have to do it myself)

## Can MAYBE happen List:
- [ ] Multiplayer support?
- [ ] 2D Game?

### Enjoy!
