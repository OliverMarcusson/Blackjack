# Blackjack
My first real python project.

## TODO List:
[ ] Make Ace able to turn into either one or eleven depending on the hand.
[ ] Make the player able to split it's hand if there are 2 cards of the same value.
[ ] Make it possible to save progress into savefile
[ ] Make a new shoe when previous one is empty
[ ] The player doesn't have to press enter every time they want to preform an action, instead just press a number.
[ ] Player can't bet over max bet amount.

## Can MAYBE happen List:
[ ] Multiplayer support?
[ ] 2D Game?

### Enjoy!
